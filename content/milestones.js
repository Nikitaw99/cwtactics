Beside of many under the hood updates, milestone 2 introduces some new features like information boxes, a complete game round, building units and so on. As one of first milestones, milestone 2 has a endable game round. If you conquer the enemy <strong>HQTR</strong>, the game will end. In this release you will get a message box which shows you the end of the game."
