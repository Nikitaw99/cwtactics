Neko for Custom Wars Tactics

Neko is the base engine behind the Custom Wars Tactics game. It rather tries to reuse rexisting stuff, than re-implementing it. Because of this, neko implements a robust module system to connect them all into a usable state to 
be more flexible without having to recode things or building wrappers.

The main parts of neko are:
  - core; contains the module system and useful basic functions for classes
  - utils; contains various stuff for solving different tasks
    ( this uses mainly third party frameworks and integrates them nicely 
      into the neko module namespace )
  - tbs; contains many basic things, that can be used to program turn based
    games

Neko can be used for other games as well, as long the project accepts the rules of the neko license.
