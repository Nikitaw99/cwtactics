F: HOW TO BUILD THE STYLE.CSS
A: You need to use the less library to convert style.less to style.css. 
   You may convert it in the browser or via the less homepage. Furthermore
   ( this is the prefered way ) you can use Adobe Brackets with the 
   LESS plugin which converts the style.less automatically to style.css if
   you edit it.
