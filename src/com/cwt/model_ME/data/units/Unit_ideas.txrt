 => SCOUT
    As beloved by all players we maybe add for the CWT main mod an unit named SCOUT. A scout is 
    mainly understand able as light sniper. His work isn't to camp on a point and shoot enemy out.
    No it is a very usefull unit. First it is an infantry and not need any fuel and has a very
    high range of vision. It's main work is to scout out enemy positions to make easier for 
    indirect attacks. Furthermore if an unit is attacked by an indirect attack and this unit is 
    scouted by a scout, the indirect attack gets a slight bonus ( +10 ).
    The range of the scouts weapon is 2 tiles direct, damage against tanks is 0 , against soft 
    units it has a typical hit rate of 10 to 25. The salary of the scout is very high and it cannot
    move and shoot in the same turn.
