Project : MeoW Shell Engine
Version : coming 2.0 Black Cat
Authors : Alexander Radom
Contributors : Crecen Carr

Prerequisites :
 - Java Runtime Environment v.5 or greater

Notes:

The MeoW Shell engine is an easy API to realize a trigger event based
system from outside. The engine allows to set triggers in your program and
reacting on it over script file. Mainly developed as scripting engine for simple
turn based games can MeoWShell easy gain coding abilities to the end user. It
makes possible to allow controlled scripting from outside of the program.
The syntax of MeoW Shell is very inspired by Python.
