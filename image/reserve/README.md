# Reserve Images

Instead of just deleting everything, I placed all the current images within a reserve folder. This will allow developers time to change the image conventions and also to have a place to store images that may be used in the future.

## Disclaimer

Images in these folders might be moved or deleted at any time. If you want to use any of them, be sure to move them out of the reserve folder before connecting any program stuff to them.

## AW2 Tileset

When the AW2 tile set comes around, the ROAD(S) images will be used for it. The snowy roads will be used for the CWT_Tileset. It is a good step for differentiating the difference between CWT and the AW series.
