This is a small readme for requests by the artists for how this art was meant to be colored, if you feel like taking their advice. Of course, this also serves as a good gallery for custom art specifically made for CWT.

How to Color the Art:

Well, there is a video on line art if any is interested...

Sami Sketch - by bbzee:

"If you're coloring Sami character, make sure to color her vest black and her pants is (Orange/Dark Green stripes). This was my idea from the very beginning, so I hope you take that as a note."

JSRulz (All Sketches):

"If you are coloring my artwork, try to stick as close to the original design as possible."
