This is the place where artwork from various archives are collected, just in case the original hosters go down. I really did hope that I would never have to use this place, but, it is what it is I guess. If the content becomes too heavy, it will be separated into its own branch in the future to relieve clutter from the main branch.

The archive folder contains all the artwork that was hosted on advancewars.net. Plenty of CO sprites, animations, and AW artwork is now stored on this webpage.

As a token of appreciation for reaching 25,000 page views. Here is a dump of all the data we managed to save from Advance Wars Network. A great site with a lot of good memories, and one of the places that helped build this team and keep Advance Wars alive.
