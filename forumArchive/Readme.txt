This is the place where artwork from various archives are collected, just in case the original hosters go down. I really did hope that I would never have to use this place, but, it is what it is I guess. If the content becomes too heavy, it will be separated into its own branch in the future to relieve clutter from the main branch.

The archive folder contains all the artwork that was hosted on advancewars.net. Plenty of CO sprites, animations, and AW artwork is now stored on this webpage.
