		<h1>Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising</h1>
<h1>Sensei's Return</h1>
<p><b>
Sensei vs. Adder
<br />Difficulty: ***</b>
<p>Adder hears that the plundered supplies are making way into 
factory-built units, which he's happy to hear. Yellow Comet forces
have arrived, so his thoughts are terminated for now. Adder doesn't
seem to care for Sensei's brave words, even with the quote from Sensei
through Lenin "He who laughs last laughs best." Adder says he'll beat
you in 10 days. It's in FOW, so good luck to you!
</p>

<li>Adder Day 10: Sideslip. His infantry moves in to capture airport,
his A-Air attacks your infantry on base, and another infantry
effectively besieges your infantry on base.
</li>
<li>Sensei Day 11: Move your battle copter 1N to take out that infantry,
then use an infantry to attack the mech. Move up your recon to spot
Adder's tank. Your battle copter will deal with that..heh heh...

one infantry and hurt the other.

copter 1E to deal 9 damage on that missile. Move recon 1S. Use 7HP

and move in your medium tanks. The back infantry and battle copters
should head for HQ. The infantry on middle island near BH cities should
take them. In the west, use your battle copters to take out a mech with
infantry help that is on the western base, the rocket, and an infantry
so your western units can seize temporarily control over the SW BH
base and weaken an infantry.
</li>
<li>Adder Day 16: Attack an infantry with the last 3HP tank, clear a 6HP
infantry on the SW BH base with an A-Air, and take out 5HP infantry
with mech. Build two mechs.
</li>
<li>Sensei Day 17: Move back the 4HP tank to attack the 3HP tank and
trap it in the forest. Move up medium tank to attack infantry on HQ.
With massive battle copter help, take out two infantry and two mechs,
blocking all three bases with transport copters or a recon (SW base).
In the middle, use 9HP infantry to take out tank.
</li>
<li>Adder Day 17: With only one A-Air left, he takes out a battle copter.
</li>
<li>Sensei Day 18: Use a medium tank and then a battle copter to finish off
that final A-Air. Send battle copters east, as he is hiding a unit there.
</li>
<li>Adder Day 18: Sideslip. The APC moves out of the forest in the northeast.
</li>
<li>Sensei Day 19: Take out the APC with two battle copters to win.
</li></ul>
<p>Adder remembers that Yellow Comet once boasted a CO that was unbeatable,
which turns out to be Sensei. Even Sonja was surprised. Adder leaves.
A different victory screen showing infantry forces shows up here. Good
job!
</p>
<p><b>Victory!</b> 99 Speed + 100 Power + 97 Technique = 296 Pts. = S Rank!
</p>
<p>Your victory opens three new missions. Now all your choices are ****.
Take the southernmost one.</p>
