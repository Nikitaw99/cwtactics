Move lander 6E as bait.
</li>
<li>Lash Day 8: Doesn't take bait and attacks full HP medium tank with
upper minicannon, moves bomber to take out artillery. Move copter down
to hit tank. Build ANOTHER bomber.
</li>
<li>Jess Day 9: Move up second battleship, make a 3rd, attack with 1st

</li>
<li>Lash Day 10: Burn APC with minicannon. Join 5+4HP battleships. Bomb

</li>
<li>Jess Day 11: Overdrive! Finish taking NW port. Move up 3rd battleship.
Aim for one battleship with both battleships in front, plus both medium
tanks to take it out so she only has 5 left! Move A-Air 2E to take out
battle copter. Move artillery NE. Start capturing NE base with mech.
Move up infantry and A-Air. Be happy that you're still on track to win!
</li>
<li>Lash Day 11: Cannon blast APC to 4HP. Prime Tactics. Bomber bombs down
APC. Bomber kills artillery (perfect bait for A-Air). Battle copter
destroys small 3HP tank in battleship zone. Move back T-Copter, build
a battle copter.
</li>
<li>Jess Day 12: Move mech on western island to take final city. Build
battleship from that port on the island. With both full HP battleships
and two medium tanks, take out another battleship. Weaken another one
with 5HP battleship. Take out bomber with A-Air, and move up other one
as well. Continue taking BH base with mech. Move recon northwest. Move
infantry north for bait later. Build FINAL A-Air from SE base.
</li>
<li>Lash Day 12: Cannon blasts one A-Air. Bomber finishes 5HP battleship.
Battle copter does 2 damage to battleship, other battle copter moves
down. Move T-Copter to heal.
</li>
<li>Jess Day 13: Move full HP battleship west to weaken bomber to 2HP. Move
up other weakened A-Air to battleship zone, avoiding cannon. Move recon
west. On western island, finish capturing city. You now have three
full battleships, two that can attack. There are four battleships left
to take out, and you have 5 days. Move newly built battleship 5E. Check
its range. Do not kill ANY battleship in that range, but you can weaken
them. With two battleships at half-HP due to your two battleships and
medium tanks, they will surely join together to become three overall.
Move up infantry. Continue taking BH base with mech. Move northwest
final A-Air. Have nothing in cannon range.
</li>
<li>Lash Day 13: Weaken battleship and medium tank from bridge, which means
A-Air can attack next turn. Other battle copter takes infantry bait
instead of hitting battleship. Build nothing.
</li>
<li>Jess Day 14: Overdrive! Move 3rd battleship NE. Use other two
battleships to wipe out the 8HP joined battleship. Move 9HP A-Air up
to take out full HP battle copter. Move down 4HP A-Air to take out
bomber. Use remaining medium tank to attack cannon from west. Finish
off final battle copter. Now Lash has no way of winning. No chance.
Finish capturing base with mech. Move up recon only to bridges out of
cannon range. Build a battleship from western island port.
</li>
<li>Lash Day 14: Doomed as mushrooms, she uses Prime Tactics...and can't
do anything. Haha.
</li>
<li>Jess Day 15: Continue smashing cannon with medium tank from the left.
Pull up farthest battleship NE. Weaken a battleship to 2HP. Pull last
battleship east just in case. 
</li>
<li>Lash Day 15: Think it's still a game, keep healing T-Copter.
</li>
<li>Jess Day 16: Use 6HP battleship to down 2HP battleship. Use other two
battleships in range to weaken battleship and finish off cannon. Move
up final battleship. 
</li>
<li>Lash Day 16: Lash only has one day to finish, a BH infantry reports.
Lash thinks that they are almost finished so doesn't care. Do nothing.
</li>
Jess Day 17: Final day. Use ANY battleship to sink her battleship. If
it isn't enough, add another one, but I doubt it. Jess tells everyone
to retreat after their victory because more BH forces will win. Nice
going...victory! Lash no longer feels it's like a game, so it's time
you take her seriously? Lash is angry.
