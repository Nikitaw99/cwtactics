to save the factory or he will know no peace and no forgiveness.
Hawke can't do much but agree. Eagle and Jess order an attack onto
the factory, even with the entire BH forces there. Kanbei arrives to
aid GE. Nell arrives as well to help GE. "Blue Moon can't send soldiers,
but their support is unwavering." With all three countries' forces
prepared to liberate Green Earth, it's time you start taking this
seriously once again, as this is a ****** mission. Choose Drake, Max,
