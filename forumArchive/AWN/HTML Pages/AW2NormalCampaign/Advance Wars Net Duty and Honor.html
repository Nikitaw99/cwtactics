		<h1>Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising</h1>
<h1>Duty and Honor</h1>
<p><b>
Kanbei vs. Adder
<br />Difficulty: ****</b>
</p>
<p>The laser cannon has been deployed for Adder on a mountain. Flak doubts
YC will actually go up it, but Adder replies that he'd siege YC cities
if they don't. Flak helps him deploy infantry. The cities are for 
bait...
</p>
<p>Kanbei wants to fight, but Sonja notices the trap and notes that the
cities aren't too important. Kanbei replies that they are YC COs and
can't let more of Yellow Comet be taken. Look around the map to find
two Laser Cannons that fire like a cross...so the early roads are
covered. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Kanbei Day 1: Move left APC and infantry 1N. Move bottom 2 mechs
2E. Move other three 1SE. Move other infantry 1NE and other APC 1N 2E.
Move the back medium tank 5N, and the other two 2N 3E. Move tanks 1E
4N. Move left rocket 1E 3N and the right rocket 1NE. Move left 
artillery 2E 3N. Move right artillery 4E 1N.
</li>
<li>Adder Day 1: Move up something like half the army.
</li>
<li>Kanbei Day 2: Sonja tells Kanbei what the laser cannons do. They can't
fire all the time, but if you get 10 YC cities taken, you lose. Move
units in this formation (northeast tank takes out enemy recon):
<pre>Infantry APC    Md Tank  Md Tank  Tank
         Artly  Md Tank  Tank
         Mech   Inf      Mech
         Mech   Mech     Mech
                Artly    APC</pre>
Your other rockets should move 2N as well.
</li>
<li>Adder Day 2: Fire laser cannons, attack tank with tank. Advance
infantry and mechs.
</li>
<li>Kanbei Day 3: Retreat front tank. Send in full health medium tank to
kill the tank. Move every unit not on road north and every other unit
east. Pull as far east as you can. Your formation should now be a
2-square wide horizontal line stretching from the 2 rockets in the west
to the edge of the road to the right. The artillery should be weakened,
too.
</li>
<li>Adder Day 3: Artillery deals 1 damage to your artillery. Take out 1HP
medium tank with his tank. Infantry and mechs advance toward 10 cities.
</li>
<li>Kanbei Day 4: Move both rockets north within range of the upper Laser
Cannon to kill it Day 5. Use full health medium tank to take out tank
in one hit. Take out artillery with weakened tank. Move everything else
out of cannon range and weaken the tank with your mech.
</li>
<li>Adder Day 4: Both laser cannons miss. Tank attacks APC. Units move up.
</li>
<li>Kanbei Day 5: Destroy upper laser cannon with both rockets. Continue to
send medium tanks and tanks. Put APC onto city to lure BH tanks. Move
along the road everything, and take out that western tank with a mech.
</li>
<li>Adder Day 5: Start capturing two of 10 cities. Two tanks take APC
bait and kill it. Tanks, medium tanks, artillery, infantry, and mechs
move up.
</li>
<li>Kanbei Day 6: Take out ONE tank with medium tank, staying out of laser
cannon range, and weaken the other one in cannon range with your
artillery. Move up units to take on the medium tank Day 7. Continue
moving units up. Now, you should have 2 medium tanks, 1 tank, an APC,
an infantry, and a mech in the front lines with your rockets and back
mechs moving up. STAY OUT OF RANGE!
</li>
<li>Adder Day 6: Fire the laser cannon that deals his own tank 1 damage.
Sidewinder. Finish capturing two cities and start capturing another
one. Attack tank with tank. Join tanks. Attack artillery with medium
tank. 
</li>
<li>Kanbei Day 7: Move back weakened artillery. Attack medium tank with 
other artillery and weakened medium tank. Finish it with 4HP tank.
Move up medium tank to take out newly joined 9HP tank. Move up
rockets. Move units as far east along the road as you can.
</li>
<li>Adder Day 7: Finish capturing another city and start capturing two
more. Move units west. Attack mech with tank. 
</li>
<li>Kanbei Day 8: Finish tank with medium tank. Move units eastward but
keep out of cannon range. Have one rocket in range of cannon for
Days 9-10.
</li>
<li>Adder Day 8: Fire off laser cannon that does nothing to anyone.
Capture a total of 6 cities and start taking 7th. Take out infantry
with artillery. Take out tank with medium tank. Attack infantry on city
with medium tank.
</li>
<li>Kanbei Day 9: Attack the cannon with your rocket and deal 71% down to
28HP. Weaken both medium tanks with rocket and both artillery. Move
medium tank east to get ready to retake cities. Take out the medium
tank. Move east units.
</li>
<li>Adder Day 9: Finish capturing seven cities. You now must attack at
least one mech to survive now...finish tank with rocket. Move everything
up.
</li>
<li>Kanbei Day 10: Samurai Spirit! Rocket to destroy laser cannon, finish
off medium tank with your back one. Finish off mech taking NW city with
full health medium tank. Move everything else all the way east along
the road but keep out of artillery/rocket fire unless you must take out
that mech to stay alive (which you must). 
</li>
<li>Adder Day 10: Have 9 cities captured and start to capture that last
city again. Move artillery NE but keep rockets there. 
</li>
<li>Kanbei Day 11: Move rockets NE as far as possible. Attack mech taking
final city with medium tank even under artillery fire. Move other
medium tank to deal 8 damage to a mech next to it. Move APC, mechs,
and artillery east out of rocket range. 
</li>
<li>Adder Day 11: Continue taking city, take out an artillery (instead of
your full-health medium tank being attacked), other medium tank hurt by
other artillery, move up infantry and artillery in the west. 
</li>
<li>Kanbei Day 12: With front rocket, take out front artillery in one shot.
Finish an infantry with your artillery, and take out 4HP mech with 4HP
medium tank. Move the other medium tank ONTO that city and kill the
infantry to the east. Move everything else east but stay out of rocket
range.
</li>
<li>Adder Day 12: Sidewinder. Artillery attacks infantry. Move up western
artillery.
</li>
<li>Kanbei Day 13: Move APC to fueling city and ONE mech west near APC.
You will send APC and mech to kill that artillery in the west. Other
units should take out the final artillery in the northeast and prepare 
to take out the rockets with the APC. 
</li>
<li>Adder Day 13: Do nothing.
</li>
<li>Kanbei Day 14: Move mech and APC west to artillery. Take out infantry
with medium tank. Send everything you have at the two rockets.
</li>
<li>Adder Day 14: Artillery moves west and nearly runs out of fuel, two
rockets kill a rocket.
</li>
<li>Kanbei Day 15: With your advanced rocket and artillery, injure both
rockets. Use weakened medium tank to kill the first rocket. Attack APC
with mech. Continue chasing western artillery. Move everything else in
the east south.
</li>
<li>Adder Day 15: Artillery northeast, rocket attacks but deals nothing.
</li>
<li>Kanbei Day 16: The artillery you can see has run out of fuel. Chase the
artillery again. In the east, take out both rocket and APC and move the
rest back west. 
</li>
<li>Adder Day 16: ...
</li>
<li>Kanbei Day 17-18: Attack artillery with mech. Finish artillery with 
mech. You have won! Adder notices that the YC COs are tough and decide
to retreat to the factory. Kanbei seems to have done the right thing in
saving the 10 cities...
