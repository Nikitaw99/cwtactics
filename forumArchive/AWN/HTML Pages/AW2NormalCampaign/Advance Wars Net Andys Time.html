		<h1>Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising</h1>
<h1>Andy's Time</h1>
<p><b>Andy vs. Flak
<br />Difficulty: **</b>
</p>
<p><b>Mission Briefing:</b> Lash tells Flak about her new invention, the Black 
Cannon. Hawke urges Flak to complete his conquest of Orange Star, but he 
seems be reeling backwards, eh? Commander Andy and Nell notices the 
giant cannon, and Max argues Andy can't take it, he can with his 
strength. Andy still is confident, however, and will do it himself.
</p>
<p><b>Mission Terms:</b> Andy's Time introduces you to Lash's new invention, the
Black Cannon, which deals five damage to the strongest unit with the most
HP in its range, which covers some 82 squares and has 99HP. Ignore it if
you can until you attack it.
</p>
<pre><b>Starting Properties:</b>

               OS BH Neutral
Cities          3  1  8
Factories       2  1  3
Airports        0  0  0
Seaports        0  0  0
Missile Silos   0  0  0


<b>Predeployed Units:</b>

OS: 1 Infantry, 1 Transport Copter
BH: Black Cannon
</pre>
<p><b>General Strategic Checklist:</b>
</p>
<dl><dt>1. Stay out of Black Cannon range until you attack it, and when you do,
attack from range.
</dt>
<dd>Although the Black Cannon on this first mission will only attack every
few turns, it's to your best interests to stay out of the way, as you
can capture the middle base out of Black Cannon range, as well as send
rockets to smash it from afar.
</dd>
<dt>2. Capture the middle and northwest factories.
</dt>
<dd>Flak is slow and won't reach either base in time if you use your
transport copter. It's also a nice way to flank him.
</dd>
<dt>3. Occupy Flak's factory within several days.
</dt>
<dd>With your superior property advantage, you should be able to seize
control of it so Flak doesn't go slapping you when you attack Lash's
Black Cannon.
</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Black Hole Strats:</b> Flak doesn't get much, so he'll build infantry and
small vehicles to attempt to match your superior forces. Chances are
he won't last...
</p>
<p><b>To S-Rank:</b> Take both neutral factories over ASAP, and also neutralize
Flak's deployment base. Smash BH's small force quickly.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>General Strategy Day 1:</b> Move toward central island.
</li>
<li>Andy Day 1: You notice you only have 1 infantry and 1 transport copter,
but you do get deployment bases to deploy new units. Nell talks on
about how to make units. Look around on the map. BH has a base north of
you, east of the cannon. The cannon has 99HP and can destroy
practically everything. Watch out with that. There are three bases to
the west of both of you. Move the infantry into the transport copter
and move it all the way west. Deploy two infantry.
</li>
<li>Flak Day 1: The cannon will fire starting Day 2, and Lash tells Flak
to advance south.
</li>
<li><b>General Strategy Day 2:</b> Land on central island to grab that base, and
move infantry north.
</li>
<li>Andy Day 2: Check out the cannnon's range, which seems to cover a
massive range of about 82 squares! The best you can do right now is
avoid being fired upon. Move your T-Copter all the way up and drop to
the south onto the base. Move your western infantry to capture the
city, and move the other one 3N. Build an infantry in the left base
and tank in the right base. 
</li>
<li>Flak Day 2: An infantry moves SE to take a city. He builds another one.
</li>
<li><b>General Strategy Day 3:</b> Move units north and take middle base.
</li>
<li>Andy Day 3: Nell informs you to attack the Black Cannon door. By the
looks of it, it's best if you attack with an indirect unit or you'll
get blasted. Start capturing base on middle island. Finish capturing
other city. Move left infantry 3N, right infantry 2N 1W. Move tank
6N. Make another infantry and another tank. Move T-Copter 2S 4E. 
</li>
<li>Flak Day 3: He finishes capturing a city, moves infantry, and makes
yet another one. Poor guy with no money :)
</li>
<li><b>General Strategy Day 4:</b> Take central island, strike BH units from
the south.
</li>
<li>Andy Day 4: Finish capturing the base on the central island. Move your
northernmost infantry 3N to start capturing the city. Move up your tank
5N 1W to attack the infantry on the city. Move your infantry from 3S of
the transport copter and move it 3N into the copter, and move it 3NW.
Move your two infantry 3N and tank 6N. Build an APC on the left base
and an infantry on the right base. 
</li>
<li>Flak Day 4: He begins capturing a neutral city, backed by two other
infantry. He makes a mech.
</li>
<li><b>General Strategy Day 5:</b> Seize control of the left base to surround
the remaining BH forces.
</li>
<li>Andy Day 5: Move your transport copter 1W 5N and drop the infantry to 
the left. Move your northern tank 3W to kill the infantry. Move your
other tank 6N. Finish capturing the neutral city on the right side with
your infantry. Move the infantry on the central island 3N. Move your
left infantry (that is left) 3N and the one east of it 2N 1W. Move your
infantry on the right base 2W into the APC. Move the APC 1E 5N, and
drop your infantry north. Build nothing.
</li>
<li>Flak Day 5: BH units capture ONE city, and another infantry unit is
built. 
</li>
<li><b>General Strategy Day 6:</b> Close in on the last base and build a rocket.
</li>
<li>Andy Day 6: OK, you've at a clear advantage now. Move your infantry
west of the T-Copter 2W to begin capturing the base. Move your left
tank 1N to attack the infantry on the city, and move your infantry
on the middle island 2N to finish that one off. Move your other tank
3W 2N to deal damage to the mech to the left. Build a rocket on the
middle island base. Move all infantry except the one just above the APC
3N. Move that last infantry into the APC 5N and drop east. End turn.
</li>
<li>Flak Day 6: BH infantry moves 3S to attack your infantry. Another one
moves onto a city and attacks another one. A mech moves west and fails
to kill your T-Copter. 
</li>
<li><b>General Strategy Day 7:</b> Move rocket up, surround BH base with anything
you can muster.
</li>
<li>Andy Day 7: Move your rocket 3N. Move the infantry above the rocket
1NE to finish off the mech. Finish capturing the top base. Move your
bottom 9HP tank 1SE and deal that infantry 6 damage. Finish it with
your 4HP infantry without moving from below. Move the infantry below it
3N to attack the infantry on the city. Move the infantry east of the
APC 2N to finish it. Attack the infantry on the base with your tank.
Move your APC 4N, and your T-Copter 4E 1S. Move your other infantry
3W. Create an artillery on the middle island base.
</li>
<li>Flak Day 7: He's doomed. His infantry on the base attacks your T-Copter
and does three damage.
</li>
<li><b>General Strategy Day 8:</b> Effectively take the surrounded BH base and
build a rocket. 
</li>
<li>Andy Day 8: Move your rocket 2N 1W. Move your artillery 4N. Your tank
west of that enemy infantry should attack it and bring it to 2HP. Move
your T-Copter 6W. Move your full health infantry 2W 1N and finish that
infantry off. Move your 9HP infantry 2N and capture that enemy base.
From your northwest base, move that infantry 1W 2S and build a rocket
from there. Move your APC 6W, your 4HP infantry 2N 1W, your other 9HP
tank 5W, your 5HP infantry 3W, and your full health infantry 1S to
capture the BH city.
</li>
<li>Flak Day 8: He has no base or units. Do nothing.
</li>
<li><b>General Strategy Day 9:</b> With your two rockets, destroy the 99HP cannon.
</li>
<li>Andy Day 9: With your rocket on the base, attack the cannon down to
44HP. Finish it off with your other rocket. You win! 
</li>
<li>Andy and Flak have a clash of words and then Andy spots Max's tank
force. Maybe it'll be helpful?
</li></ul>
<p><b>Victory!</b> 100 Speed + 100 Power + 100 Technique = 300 = S Rank! You
now have 1,800 points.
</p>
<p>With most of Orange Star now secure, you have to hop to the last
island. Andy will provide you assistance in marching into the
mountains to take out that final Black Hole lab.
