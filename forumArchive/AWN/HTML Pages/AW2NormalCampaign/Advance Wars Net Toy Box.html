		<h1>Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising</h1>
<h1>Toy Box</h1>
<p><b>
Olaf vs. Lash
<br/>Difficulty: ***</b>
</p>

<p>Olaf prepares his forces to enter his hometown and liberate his
hometown from Black Hole forces.
</p>
<p>Olaf and Lash have some talk about what happened to his hometown due
to Lash. Olaf is furious and demands to take Lash 1 on 1 for his
hometown back and to find what Lash has hidden. 
</p>
<ul><li>Olaf Day 1: Build two infantry.
</li>
<li>Lash Day 1: Build two infantry.
</li>
<li>Olaf Day 2: Send both infantry 3W and build two more.
</li>
<li>Lash Day 2: BH starts capturing two cities and builds two more infantry.
</li>
<li>Olaf Day 3: Move both northern infantry 3W. In the south, move the
front one 3N and the back one 3W. Build two more infantry.
</li>
<li>Lash Day 3: Lash takes two cities and builds two more infantry after
moving the other two east.
</li>
<li>Olaf Day 4: ANY infantry in range should capture a city, and the one
close to the base should capture the base. The remaining infantry
should move 3W. Make a recon on the northern base and an infantry on
the southern base.
</li>
<li>Lash Day 4: Her infantry move west. Your northern infantry is fired
upon but the city's defensive power leads you well. She builds a recon
and an APC.
</li>
<li>Olaf Day 5: Capture three cities and the base. Continue capturing the
northwest city. Move other two infantry 3W. Move recon 3W. Build
nothing.
</li>
<li>Lash Day 5: His forces move eastward. The infantry in the north
resumes attacking your infantry. She builds nothing either.
</li>
<li>Olaf Day 6: Finish capturing northern city. Move infantry on central
base 1SW to attack that infantry. Move infantry on northeast city
2S 1W as well as the one west of it. Move recon 5W. Make tank in
central base. Move infantry (in terms of closest to middle base) in
this order: 2N 1W, 2N, and 3W. End turn.
</li>
<li>Lash Day 6: Recon moves up, two infantry combined kill yours on the
southern front. In the north, the city/river fighting continues.
</li>
<li>Olaf Day 7: Retreat your 4HP infantry from the northern city 3E and
move your recon 1W to finish off that infantry. Move tank 1SW and
finish off 6HP infantry. In the south, move the northernmost
infantry 1W to east of tank, and the other two 2N 1W. The other two
northern infantry should move 1SW. Build an artillery.
</li>
<li>Lash Day 7: Her recon attacks your infantry. She doesn't dare attack
anything else but does move in.
</li>
<li>Olaf Day 8: Move your tank 3W 1N to attack the enemy tank. Use your
artillery to attack the enemy recon. On the northern front, keep your
recon's guns firing at the infantry left of you. Move your 3HP
infantry next to the recon 1N 2E and move the 4HP infantry 1W 2S.
Move BM infantry in to surround the BH infantry and kill it. Move
other infantry west.
</li>
<li>Lash Day 8: Recon attacks 4HP infantry to 2HP. Builds mech and 
artillery. Moves units east.
</li>
<li>Olaf Day 9: Continue dealing damage with recon on northern front. Kill
enemy tank with yours. Move everything from southern front west, 
including artillery. Attack the recon from the south with a full
health infantry. Build a medium tank. Move 3HP infantry southeast.
</li>
<li>Lash Day 9: An infantry comes in to down your 2HP infantry. 
</li>
<li>Olaf Day 10: Destroy enemy APC with tank and artillery. Capture
southwest neutral city. Attack anything in sight but stay away from
enemy artillery range except for that tank. Use the 3HP infantry to
take out the 1HP recon. Move medium tank 1S 2W. Create an artillery.
</li>
<li>Lash Day 10: Destroys tank with artillery, infantry with infantry.
</li>
<li>Olaf Day 11: Finish capturing the southwest neutral city. It is a map
that pinpoints to the hidden enemy lab. You will now unlock the hidden
Blue Moon lab mission. Continue taking out units with northern recon,
and use that near-full health northern infantry to chase hers. Move
medium tank to take out infantry in the way to the northwest and
southwest. Move front infantry north of the medium tank, and use an 
infantry to attack her mech and block your artillery. Build a rocket.
</li>
<li>Lash Day 11: Her recon and infantry attack your artillery, and the 
mech kills your infantry. 
</li>
<li>Olaf Day 12: Use Blizzard. Send infantry from SW city northeast. 
Weaken recon with medium tank. Move up rocket. Kill wandering Lash
infantry in the east. Build a tank. Injure APC. End.
</li>
<li>Lash Day 12: Advance troops east.
</li>
<li>Olaf Day 13: Move Rocket 1S 2W. Take out APC with southern artillery.
Take out mech next to northern recon with artillery and recon. Finish
infantry with medium tank. Move the rest up and build a tank.
</li>
<li>Lash Day 13: Advance and build an infantry and mech.
</li>
<li>Olaf Day 14: With your southern artillery, attack the mech. With your
rocket, attack the infantry on the base. Kill another infantry with
medium tank. Finish the southern mech with your tanks. Advance toward
SOUTHWEST base. Build a tank.
</li>
<li>Lash Day 14: Mech attacks northern recon. Move infantry up in the
south. Build two mechs.
</li>
<li>Olaf Day 15: Continue sweeping units with indirect units first, aiming
for mechs first. With your tanks, you should be able to take out the
mech and infantry defending SW base...as the artillery is out of the
way. Use your infantry as well to help. By end this should be cleared
all but 3HP artillery. Finish off mech in the north with medium tank.
Build a rocket.
</li>
<li>Lash Day 15: Build an infantry and mech.
</li>
<li>Olaf Day 16: Take out the final artillery and infantry in the southwest 
with two tanks and a rocket. Use your infantry to capture the SW base. 
Take out the 5HP recon with your artillery, and injure a mech in the 
NW. Move up units to NW and end.
</li>
<li>Lash Day 16: She uses Prime Tactics. Unit movement cost goes to 1, but
she only has 3 full mechs even after building one. She doesn't attack.
</li>
<li>Olaf Day 17: Start capturing HQ. Attack mechs with medium tank and
a tank. Finish the 2HP mech with your 5HP infantry, and with an
artillery and infantry, take out the mech in front of your tank. Move
tank to cover SW base, and move all other units towards NW base.
</li>
<li>Lash Day 17: Take out an infantry with a mech, advance mech, and use
mech.
</li>
<li>Olaf Day 18: In the northwest, kill front two mechs with rockets and 
artillery. Use the medium tank and a tank to finish that final mech.
</li></ul>
<p>Lash leaves and you've won. Olaf's memories come back to him as he
looks at his shattered hometown. He promises to avenge Black Hole's
actions.
</p>
<p><b>Victory!</b> 100 Speed + 100 Power + 85 Technique = 285 Pts. = S-Rank!
</p>
<p>This victory opens up a mission on the island. Anyhow, move to the
northwest flag to Mission 12.
