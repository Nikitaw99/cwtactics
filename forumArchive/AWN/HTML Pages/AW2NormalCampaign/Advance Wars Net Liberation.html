		<h1>Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising</h1>
<h1>Liberation</h1>
<p><b>Andy, Max, or Sami vs. Flak
<br />Difficulty: ****</b>
</p>
<p><b>Mission Briefing:</b> Flak is surprised by the sight of Adder, who was 
supposed to invade Yellow Comet. With his wordplay, he angers Flak. 
Here is a factory and base that is the center of the BH war on OS. If 
you can take this out, victory on BH will be a reality, at least in 
OS, for now. You have the base advantage here.
</p>
<p><b>Mission Terms:</b> Entering the final mission of the Orange Star Campaign,
you hold a disadvantage due to Black Hole's factory, which is given
units through a pipeline. You'll want to seize the neutral airport early
and smash the pipeline seem.
</p>
<pre><b>Starting Properties:</b>

               OS BH Neutral
Cities          2  2 11
Factories       3  1  2
Airports        0  0  0
Seaports        0  0  0
Missile Silos   0  0  0
</pre>
<p><b>General Strategic Checklist:</b>
</p>
<dl>
<dt>1. Destroy the pipeline seem for a quicker and easier victory.
</dt>
<dd>See the weak spot, the pipeline seem, in the pipeline? That's where
you should hit it to break the pipeline connection and stop the
factory from building more, as well as win the mission.
</dd>
<dt>2. Take the neutral airport away from BH hands.
</dt>
<dd>The lone airport is vital if you want to take out the seem fast.
Capture the base below it, too, if you don't plan on taking Flak
down within first 10 days.
</dd>
<dt>3. Take lone eastern cities if you have the time.
</dt>
<dd>The eastern cities will supply that extra 2000 a day you could use.
</dd>
<dt>4. Block factory from producing units.
</dt>
<dd>The BH factory can be blocked from cranking any more units out, by
blocking the three doors.
</dd>
<dt>5. Produce an APC and infantry early.
</dt>
<dd>Use both units to speed to the airport/base.
<dd>
<dt>6. Seize the west as a diversion.
</dt>
<dd>This won't really help speed or technique, but if this mission is a
bit rough, marching units west and taking that SW neutral base will
be useful.
</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Black Hole Strats:</b> Flak's forces have stepped up a notch, and now
uses more indirect units to throw mushrooms on your head. Block
the bridges with anything you can, and you'll want to seize the skies
even with A-Air and missiles threatening you.
</p>
<p><b>To S-Rank:</b> You'll want to rush and crush the pipeline seem while keeping
some strong attacks on units at and near the factory for power.
</p>

<li>Andy Day 1: Make an APC in the northwest base, and an infantry in the
left base. 
</li>
<li>Flak Day 1: Flak orders a unit to come out of the factory, and a mech
does so. He also builds an infantry.
</li>
<li>Andy Day 2: Nell informs you that BH has also been stealing weapons,
money, and materials to make an army, and they transfer it to this

need it. Move your infantry 1W 2N into the APC, then move it 6W.
Build another APC and infantry.
</li>
<li>Flak Day 2: His infantry and mech start capturing cities. He builds an
infantry. 
</li>
<li>Andy Day 3: Nell tells you that you can't destroy the factory, but you
can destroy the breached pipeline, which has 99HP just like the Black
Cannon, so that BH doesn't get more free units. Move your left infantry
into the left APC again, and move it 1W 4N, dropping the infantry to
the right, in range of the airport. Move the other infantry into the
APC, move it 6W, and drop north. Build 3 infantry.
</li>
<li>Flak Day 3: A BH soldier notes to Flak that the breached pipeline was
discovered. Flak notes the troubles of it being destroyed, and asks

</li>
<li>Flak Day 8: A tank moves down to take out your 8HP infantry. Another

</li>
<li>Andy Day 9: Move your eastern of your bottom infantry 1NW to finish off
that infantry, then send your NeoTank 2SW to take out the tank. Move
your 5HP infantry 1E, then send the A-Air 2E 1N after him to kill the

</li>
<li>Flak Day 9: Flak's tank attacks yours on the base, which turns out to

recon from the factory.
</li>
<li>Andy Day 12: Move your NeoTank 1E 2N to take out the rocket. Move

Move the one below it 1E 2N to attack the same one. Move your 5HP

</li>
<li>Flak Day 12: His mech in the east goes to capture another city, and his
artillery strikes your tank on the eastern base. His two recon move in 
to aid his A-Air on the eastern front. More units head east. In the
west, a mech attacks your APC. The factory produces an artillery that
moves east.
</li>
<li>Andy Day 13: You now have your Super CO Power! Use Hyper Upgrade to
heal 5HP on your units and move in! Move your A-Air 2W and attack south
to deal 9 damage to the mech to the south. Note that Hyper Upgrade
actually increases 1 movement to your infantry. Move your 
northwesternmost infantry 2NE to deal 4 damage to that mech on the
base. Move your tank on the bridge 1NE to take the APC out. Move your
NeoTank 3S 4E (again, the extra movement) to take out the mech on the
river. Move the tank in the west above the bridge 2S 5E. Move your
infantry on the river in the west 3N to take out that infantry. Move
your APC 2N and the infantry below that 2N WITHOUT FIRING at the 1HP
infantry. Let it heal in the base, it won't hurt, and you can't take
the base yet anyway. Move your other tank in the west 1E 5N, and your
infantry there 1E 3N. In the east, kill the artillery with your front
tank, then move your other tank 2N to deal severe damage to that A-Air.
Move your last infantry 3N to attack the artillery. Create a tank in
the eastern base.
</li>
<li>Flak Day 13: He has money, but no base. He can heal his mech 2HP in his
base but can't build. He finishes capturing a city in the east. His
artillery takes 5HP off your tank. His recon and A-Air move towards
you, and his mech on the base attacks your APC. His missile also moves
east.
</li>
<li>Andy Day 14: In the west, take out the mech with the infantry to the
east, then use the infantry just below it to start capturing the base.
Move your other two infantry in range of the cities to begin capturing.
Move your NeoTank 3E 1N to take out his last artillery. From the
southeast, kill that A-Air with your front tank. Move the back tank 2N
1E to deal damage to the recon. Move your 5HP tank 3E 1S to take out
that recon. Move the other 3 tanks and infantry east/northeast as
far as possible. Move the APC and A-Air southeast.
</li>
<li>Flak Day 14: The factory comes with an artillery and medium tank. 
The artillery attacks the tank to the right, while an A-Air pummels 
another infantry. The Medium Tank attacks your A-Air. 
</li>
<li>Andy Day 15: Build a bomber. Send NeoTank northeast to deal 75 damage
to the pipeline. Move tanks up from the south to take out A-Air, and
move other tank west to attack artillery. Finish capturing cities and 
base in the west. Build nothing.
</li>
<li>Flak Day 15: Flak uses Super CO Power Barbaric Blow. His Artillery
takes out an A-Air and the recon attacks you. His medium tank attacks
your infantry, and his mech fires on your tank.
</li>
<li>Andy Day 16: Attack the missile with your NeoTank, the scorched pipeline
with your tank, take out A-Air with your tank, and bomb the heck out of
the BH mech. Build a NeoTank in the west.
</li>
