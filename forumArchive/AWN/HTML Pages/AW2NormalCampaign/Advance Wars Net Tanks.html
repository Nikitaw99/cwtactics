		<h1>Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising</h1>
<h1>Tanks!!!</h1>
<p><b>
Grit vs. Adder
<br/>Difficulty: **</b>
</p>
<p>BM: 2 Infantry, 4 Recon, 2 Artillery, 4 Rockets
<br/>BH: 4 Mechs, 4 Recon, 10? Medium Tanks</p>
<p>Grit wakes up to find an angry Olaf asking him to seize a victory over
the Black Hole forces in the south because it was his duty to defend
the mountains. Grit seems to take it lightly as always but still goes
before Olaf can say more. Grit spots the vast number of medium tanks 
even in Fog of War and decides not to fight them head on. Adder says 
that he went to offer a proposition to Grit, that they want Grit to 
join the Black Hole Army. Adder seems to say Grit's feelings about 
protecting Blue Moon, which wasn't much, but Grit doesn't respond. 
Grit agrees that Adder is correct, but that Adder has no call to 
treat the civilians and people in Blue Moon as they pleased. Adder 
had destroyed whole cities, and Grit finds Adder his #1 enemy. 
</p>
<p><b>General Strategy:</b> You have rockets. Grit is awesome with rockets. They 
fall in a single turn to medium tanks, though. Luckily, the mountains 
will protect you for a while, so take out ALL you can so he doesn't 
advance too far and take them out. Also note that in the east you have
missile silos, the new property. They don't do much damage but they can
be useful.
</p>
<ul><li>Grit Day 1: With your left rocket, attack the middle medium tank. Move
your rocket on your HQ 2W. Move your top and bottom rockets to the 1E
and 2E of those two that are already used. Move both infantry 1E. End.
</li>
<li>Adder Day 1: His 2 recon moves in to attack your 2 infantry. His medium
tanks all move east.
</li>
<li>Grit Day 2: Here, you're taught from Olaf that you can use missile silos
to hone missiles on Adder's forces. Use the back rocket to take out the
northern recon. With your second to back rocket, injure his bottom 
recon. With the one left of that, attack the middle of the three top
medium tanks you see. With your front recon attack to the 4S 1W, the
medium tank closest to your southern forces. End.
</li>
<li>Adder Day 2: His second recon attacks your infantry on the top. His
bottom one moves up and his 1HP one flees. More medium tanks move up
in the south, and your infantry is taken out in the south.
</li>
<li>Grit Day 3: OK, so you're overwhelmed. Don't worry just yet. In the
south, use your artillery to take out the medium tank. In the north,
attack the medium tank with your artillery. Move your 1HP infantry 2E.
Use your CO Power Snipe Attack. Move your middle two recons 4W (the
top one 4W 1N). Kill the recon with your HQ rocket, the 5HP medium tank
with your next one, going left, weaken the bottom medium tank that you
spot with your next one, and with the front one, weaken the full health
medium tank in the north. End turn.
</li>
<li>Adder Day 3: Adder uses Super CO Power Superwinder to move units
even faster. His mech moves 4 squares to capture your city. His recon 
and medium tanks move in on both fronts. Your rocket is destroyed by
mechs (the front one).
</li>
<li>Grit Day 4: Move your 1HP infantry 1S 2E. With your northern artillery,
attack the medium tank furthest right. Continue hitting medium tanks
with your rockets, the ones with most HP. With the front rocket though,
use it to kill the mech on the road. Move a recon in the middle to
leftmost city without attacking, right one back to the eastern forest, 
but take the NE one. In the south, move artillery 2W.
</li>
<li>Adder Day 4: BH takes one of your cities, northern artillery injured 
by weakened medium tank, two mechs completely rid your next two rockets
ineffective. 
</li>
<li>Grit Day 5: Use Snipe Attack. Injure the mech with your southern
artillery, take out the front 5HP medium tank with your northern
artillery, and weaken the mountain mech with your non-injured rocket.
With your 2-HP rockets, take out a recon. With your last recon, take
out an infantry as well. Move 1HP infantry 3E. End.
</li>
<li>Adder Day 5: Sideslip. He captures your buildings but this time doesn't
attack with those crazy mechs. Your northern artillery is injured.
</li>
<li>Grit Day 6: With northern artillery, weaken a medium tank. Move 1HP
infantry 3E and target just east of the artillery and mech, taking
down the 3-10-2 HP medium tanks to 1-7-1 HP. With your full HP rocket,
attack the mech taking your city. With your other two, take out the
2HP mech and injure the southern recon. In the east, move your lone
recon in forest 3S 1W to attack the enemy recon and to protect your
last infantry. In the south, move your artillery 1N 4E and your recon
3E 1N. End.
</li>
<li>Adder Day 6: He continues to capture the city and in the east, the
recon wars continues. In the north, he combines his 1+7+1 medium tanks
to form 9HP and also moves up his 6HP and 5HP medium tank.
</li>
<li>Grit Day 7: Move your full HP rocket 3N. Move your 1HP infantry 2S.
Take out the recon with your two recon. Move your front 2HP rocket 2E
onto the HQ. Move your other 2HP rocket 2E. Move your middle recon 2NW
to finish off the final mech. With your northern artillery, attack the
6HP medium tank. Move southern artillery 1E 2N.
</li>
<li>Adder Day 7: His medium tanks move in and hide in forest except the
9HP one. 
</li>
<li>Grit Day 8: With your full health rocket, deal 6 damage to the rocket.
Move your 1HP infantry 1S to launch a missile. Center it on the 3HP
medium tank. Move everything to besiege the last medium tanks but
making sure that lower-HP units stay out of range.
</li>
<li>Adder Day 8: All his medium tanks hide in the forest. 
</li>
<li>Grit Day 9: Move every single recon into the medium tank infested
forest to find that they all joined together. Take out that last
medium tank to achieve victory!
</li></ul>
<p>With Adder's medium tank brigade routed, he retreats! Grit doesn't seem
to care what Olaf says, but who cares?
</p>
<p><b>Victory!</b> 96 Speed + 100 Power + 100 Technique = 296 Pts. = S-Rank!
</p>
<p>Three new missions open up here. Take the middle Olaf mission.
