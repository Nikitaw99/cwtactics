mountain with your second Neotank, and move up your artillery. Move

</li>
<li>Max Day 14: Finish off A-Air with A-Air. Move every unit to the

</li>
<li>Grit Day 16: Move up Neotank on western front to attack artillery. 
Continue to attack pipeline seem to 3HP. Take out mech on eastern
front. Move rest of units east. Move bottom Neotanks towards BH tank.
</li>
<li>Max Day 16: Start taking eastern base. Use A-Air to destroy the
pipeline seem. You win! With this victory, Olaf has finally saved
Blue Moon from Black Hole conquest and destruction. Olaf praises both
Grit and Colin for being great COs. The Orange Star COs agree that the
war has come to an end in Orange Star and Blue Moon, but there was more
to be done. 
</li></ul>
