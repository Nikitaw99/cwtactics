		<h1>Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising</h1>
<h1>Rain of Fire</h1>
<p><b>Jess vs. Hawke
<br />Difficulty: ****</b>
</p>
<p>Lash tells Hawke that Flak wants to talk to him about launching an 
attack at a volcano, with Hawke annoyingly finishing all of Flak's
comments about it being dangerous and it's why they're doing it. 
The new volcano terrain disrupts air currents. Lava pours out as well.
Flak questions Hawke to save himself as the mission begins with "The
lava's going to make little people pancakes! Tee hee hee!" Maybe like
Lash herself? :P Anyway, go on into the mission. Green Earth notices
they can't go air with the volcano nearby, so Jess takes the ground
combat forces, even with Eagle's yelling. Drake defends Jess, and
Eagle blames "letting off steam".

you can take. Make APC in SE base, infantry in NE base.

<p><b>Victory!</b> 100 Speed + 100 Power + 77 Technique = 277 Pts. = A-Rank
</p>
<p>Your victory opens up the final mission of the Green Earth campaign,
but don't go there yet, of course. You'd skip a lot...so choose the
northeast mission with CO select. This is the GE NeoTank mission.
