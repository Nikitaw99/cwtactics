		<h1>Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising</h1>
<h1>Silo Scramble</h1>
<p><b>
Kanbei vs. Flak
<br />Difficulty: **</b>
<p>Sonja informs Kanbei they installed missile silos to protect Yellow
Comet. With the Black Hole attack, the missile silos are unguarded
and Kanbei rushes off with Sonja's intel help to take on Flak. Sonja
informs Kanbei on how to use the missile silos. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Kanbei Day 1: Make two infantry.
</li>
<li>Flak Day 1: Flak seems to be everywhere, eh? He makes two as well.
</li>
<li>Kanbei Day 2: Move the left infantry 1S 2W, and move the right one 3S.
Create two more infantry.
</li>
<li>Flak Day 2: He moves his left infantry 3N and his right one 2N 1E. He
makes two more infantry.
</li>
<li>Kanbei Day 3: Finish capturing city with your infantry, then move your
southeast one 1SW to take that city. Move infantry on bases 3W. Build
an APC in the western base and an infantry in the eastern base.
</li>
<li>Flak Day 3: Start capturing port. Make Kanbei look stupid by also
making an APC and infantry.
</li>
<li>Kanbei Day 4: Finish capturing city. Move eastern base infantry into
APC. Move APC 1S 5W and drop the infantry west. Move other three
infantry 3W. Build nothing.
</li>
<li>Flak Day 4: Finish capturing a port, fire missile on units centered on
APC, make a tank.
</li>
<li>Kanbei Day 5: Move infantry closest to port to take it 1S. Move
easternmost infantry 3W. Move infantry 1NE of APC into the APC and move
it 4W 2S. Drop south. Send the northern of the two remaining infantry
2W to capture city, and the other one 3W. Build nothing.
</li>
<li>Flak Day 5: Fire a missile at the APC and two infantry near it. Start
capturing two cities. Build nothing.
</li>
<li>Kanbei Day 6: Continue capturing properties. Move easternmost infantry
3S towards missile silo. Move other infantry near other port to take it
(4HP). Move APC 2N 4E. Create two infantry. Move last 4HP infantry 3S
to deal a missile that hits two infantry and a tank near being taken
cities.
</li>
<li>Flak Day 6: Builds a lander and keeps taking cities. Thanks for the
lander, stupid Flak! :)
</li>
<li>Kanbei Day 7: Move 4HP infantry in silo territory 1E 2S to fire it at
4 infantry and 1 tank...Flak seems to be tired today, eh? That deals
an overall 15 damage. Move your full-health infantry on the other shore
1S to fire another missile at the same area to deal another 15. Continue/
finish taking properties. Move both newly made infantries 3W. Make two
tanks.
</li>
<li>Flak Day 7: Infantry on bridge nearly takes out your infantry on silo.
He builds a mech and infantry.
</li>
<li>Kanbei Day 8: Move the 1HP infantry 1N onto that missile silo and fire
it at a tank, a mech, an APC, and an infantry (HQ area) and deal it 9
damage. Move your infantry on the opposing shore on a silo 2S 1E. Move
everything as far to the silos as you can, using APC and dropping as
help. Move tanks 6W, infantry following the road except for the one 
full-health one near the APC who should hop it, follow the road, and
drop south. 
</li>
<li>Flak Day 8: Fire a missile at two tanks and two infantry. FINALLY finish
capturing two buildings after joining infantry. Move APC with infantry
east. Make an artillery.
</li>
<li>Kanbei Day 9: Follow the road as far as you can with all units in the
north. Continue capturing with 4HP infantry. Move your two infantry
near remaining missile silos in the middle to use them, both on the
mech, artillery, and tank to deal some 14 damage overall. Move APC
1S. Move infantry near final missile silo 1E 2S.
</li>
<li>Flak Day 9: Infantry in the middle starts taking the right base. A
second one via an APC comes as well. He builds a tank.
</li>
<li>Kanbei Day 10: Move your infantry on the east coast 1S onto the
missile silo to fire it on the two tanks, artillery, and mech to deal
10 damage overall. Move the back tank 6S. Move the other one 3S 2E to
attack the infantry taking the base. Move the 9HP infantry 3S, and the
full health infantry 2S 1W to start taking the base. Finish taking the
city with the 4HP infantry and continue along road with infantry. Move

base. Move everything south along the road.
</li>
<li>Flak Day 11: Move artillery and tank up, make a mech.
</li>
<li>Kanbei Day 12: Finish off the enemy infantry in the middle and continue
to take cities. Create a medium tank in the middle cause you'll be hit
later...move up the infantry from now on from eastern shore all the way
over slowly. 
</li>
<li>Flak Day 12: Take out an infantry with the advancing tank in the middle.
Start moving APC and artillery over as well.
</li>
<li>Kanbei Day 13: Send your northern medium tank all the way south and
attack the tank, then use yours from the north to finish it off. Move
your other medium tank and tank along the road, making sure your 
medium tank is in front. Continue taking cities in the middle. Build
a rocket in the middle base. Move infantry 3N on eastern shore.
</li>
<li>Flak Day 13: Move up tank, infantry, APC, and artillery.
</li>
<li>Kanbei Day 14: Take out 7HP APC with your medium tank from above. Move
your other one 1E 3S to take out the artillery. Move your rocket 2E 1S.
Move in formation to attack, without having tanks in front of medium
tanks. Make a tank and an infantry in two bases on the middle island.
</li>
<li>Flak Day 14: He moves his tanks up to you.
</li>
<li>Kanbei Day 15: Take out the tank just below you with your medium
tank. Move your other one 3S. Move everything south but not farther
than medium tanks.
</li>
<li>Flak Day 15: Move units east.
</li>
<li>Kanbei Day 16: Use rocket to kill mech. Move front medium tank 1S 3W to
take out that small tank. Move your other one 4S 1W to take out the APC.
Move your forces forward, staying out of range of the two enemy tanks. 
Make two APCs and fill them with two full health infantry. 
</li>
<li>Flak Day 16: Move units forward, move infantry to deal 1 damage to
rocket. Build two mechs.
</li>
<li>Kanbei Day 17: Take out the infantry with your tank, and move your
right medium tank 1NW to weaken the tank to the east. Move the other
medium tank 1W to take out that tank. Use the rocket to take out an
infantry. Send everything else southwest that still avoids mech/artillery
fire and takes out the small tank at 1HP. Send APCs down too. Build
another medium tank.
</li>
<li>Flak Day 17: Barbaric Blow. Moves units east, makes two mechs. See why
to keep out of range?
</li>
<li>Kanbei Day 18: Take out a mech with a medium tank. Weaken one on base
with the other one. Have the rocket attack the lander. Move everything
down...stay out of range of the mechs. Build another rocket.
</li>
<li>Flak Day 18: Move mechs out, make a mech and APC.
</li>
<li>Kanbei Day 19: Move rocket on base 1S. Attack lander with rocket. Take
out two mechs with two medium tanks. Take out another two with three
small tanks. Move APCs west, making sure to drop one on the eastern base
which is now empty of units. Move the rest down.
</li>
<li>Flak Day 19: Attack an infantry with an artillery, attack APC with
mech. 
</li>
<li>Kanbei Day 20: Build a mech, move APC west. Move in medium tanks and 
tanks to take all both mechs and the artillery, besieging the APC. Down 
the lander with any rocket and capture the port. Block the other two
bases, too.
</li>
<li>Flak Day 20: Do nothing.
</li>
<li>Kanbei Day 21: Use Morale Boost. Move in both medium tanks to take out
APC on HQ. You win!
</li></ul>
<p>With a Kanbei victory, apparently Flak is one of the greatest losers of
all time, losing to Orange Star, Blue Moon, AND Yellow Comet. And 
Kooper says he most likely smells too. Sonja hurries to tell Kanbei an 
apology for the silos, but Kanbei refuses to accept it, as it helped 
him more.
</p>
