		<h1>Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising</h1>
<h1>Foul Play</h1>
<p><b>
Sensei vs. Adder
<br />Difficulty: ****</b>
</p>
<p>Black Hole seems to be ready to sign a peace treaty with Yellow Comet
with their heavy losses in the country, and are giving a favorable
proposal to Yellow Comet. Sonja believes it's a trap, Kanbei still
wants to hear out. They reach the peace treaty location and it seems
Adder is clearing obstacles on the road to reach YC. Sensei accepts the
challenge. Sonja tells Sensei the pipe is indestructible but that the
seem can be broken. Sensei knows this battle as only a skirmish in
comparison to the past. Sensei must destroy the three minicannons to
win. Look around, the map is big. Take out the seems to bring
reinforcements from the south to the north.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Sensei Day 1: In the north, move your medium tank 2W 3N, move tank 1N
5E, and move artillery 2N 3W. Note this will play a lot like Mighty
Kanbei! from AW, so you should know to defend the choke points with
style. Build an artillery from the right base. In the south, move all
bombers 3E 4N. Move battle copters 2E 4N. Build two infantry from both
remaining bases. Move all 3 infantry into transport copters 3W and move
them 6E. Drop east. 
</li>
<li>Adder Day 1: Send everything recklessly against you. 
</li>
<li>Sensei Day 2: In the north, move regular tank 1E 2N. Move artillery on
eastern base 3N 2E. Infantry in the west 1W 2N. Move medium tank and 
artillery 1NW. Build two artillery in northern bases. In the south, use
your SE bomber and move it 7E to bomb Adder's A-Air. Use top two bombers
to bomb the two seems above you. Move one bomber in between them, and
the other one to severely injure the infantry next to it. Move your
battle copters east and have one take it out. Send all transports and
one infantry to airport. Use the other three to capture cities near
base. Create another infantry.
</li>
<li>Adder Day 2: Move down vast army.
</li>
<li>Sensei Day 3: Finish capturing two cities and start capturing the
airport. Use the bomber that attacked before to attack the other A-Air
and take 3 damage while dealing another 8. Blow up the seems with the
same bombers, then send the other two to bomb the next two seems. Use
your battle copters to weaken the medium tank nearing the airports,
take out a 2HP A-Air, and nearly kill an artillery. Use T-Copters to
surround the medium tank and use infantry. In the north, attack
the mech with your artillery and medium tank to attack tank in the
left, while finishing the A-Air with artillery and tank in the right.
Send another artillery to both sides. Build an artillery in the left
and an infantry in the right.
</li>
<li>Adder Day 3: Move down massive army. In the south, attack infantry
with tank and attack transport copter with medium tank. In the north,
advance and use some mechs to cross mountains. Also attack right tank
with medium tank.
</li>
<li>Sensei Day 4: In the north (right), attack the medium tank with both
artillery. Move the tank 1S from the city. Move the infantry from the
eastern base 3N and build another one. In the west, move the left
artillery 1W. With the right one, injure the full-health tank. In
the south, finish capturing the airport and move ALL infantry off
cities. Use CO power Copter Command! Back to the north (left), take out
the tank above your medium tank with it. Take out the mech with your
infantry, and then move your 9HP infantry up to attack the 4HP one.
Move other artillery 1W 3N onto city. Do not move infantry to the right.
In the south, finish the next seems with your two bombers and move up
your other two to start blowing up the next two. Use three battle
copters to kill a mech, injure a recon, and injure a tank. Use your
last bomber to finish off that other medium tank. Move infantry from
there northeast to take out tank, and surround other medium tank with
two transport copters. Move other one to infantry on airport. Build
infantry from bottm base. In the top left one, build an infantry as
well.
</li>
<li>Adder Day 4: Two cannons fire at that first infantry you have, now down
to 2HP. Sidewinder. In the north, take out 2HP infantry with artillery,
attack your infantry in northeast corner you recently got but didn't
move, and a Neotank attacks your medium tank in northwest. A tank takes
out an infantry in northeast. Nearly take out artillery with mech and
infantry. Move down units.
</li>
<li>Sensei Day 5: Use infantry now that you got from northeast 3S. In the
south, bomb the medium tank with your bomber. In the north, move your
artillery on western city 1S and your other infantry 1N to attack the
mech. Use Copter Command! With infantry in the northeast, attack the
rocket and missile. Also start taking the city and base there. With
your southern battle copter, injure the medium tank there to 1HP. Move
infantry north towards the broken pipeline seems. Build an infantry in
the bottom base. Move your battle copters up to weaken a missile and
take out a damaged recon. With bombers, destroy the two seems again and
use your other two to damage again. Move infantry on eastern base 1SW
to attack the seem. With your western two artillery, attack the Neotank
and deal it 6 damage. Move infantry on western base 2N. Make a medium
tank from that base. In the east, injure mech with artillery, move 1HP
artillery 2S, and use tank and two infantry to finish BH infantry and
mech. Build infantry from right base.
</li>
<li>Adder Day 5: Move units down. Neotank and Tank moves into west to attack
infantry and artillery. In the east, an infantry is destroyed. Three
total infantry taken down all over.
</li>
<li>Sensei Day 6: In the southeast, take out 1HP artillery with infantry,
and medium tank with battle copter. In the northeast, use weakened
battle copter to take out missile and use full HP battle copter to
weaken 4HP A-Air to 1. Take out missile with two infantry in very
northeast, and weaken rocket to 1HP with infantry. Continue to attempt
to take city and base. With your infantry near missile silos, aim a 
missile at that hits most units on the western front: A Neotank at
the bottom, a medium tank, three tanks, an APC, 1 infantry, and 1 mech
to deal it a massive 24 damage overall. Use the other one to aim a
little higher, aiming one with top at rocket and hitting 8 units again, 
to deal 22 damage. With western artillery and two infantry, take out
two tanks, kill an infantry, and weaken a mech. In the east, the medium
tank came in, but ignore it for now. With your front two bombers,
destroy the seems. Move in your right back bomber 6N 1E to severely
weaken that medium tank. Start capturing base below first seem with
that infantry, and move your other bomber 7N. Build a medium tank from
left base. End after killing the medium tank in the right and attacking
rocket with tank. Move two infantry to cities next to bottom seem.
Move bomber up as well.
</li>
<li>Adder Day 6: Sidewinder. Kill one artillery with tank. Take out
another infantry. Also, weakens like half your units on western front.
</li>
<li>Sensei Day 7: Capture cities and bases at pipeline seems. Move 2HP
artillery down. Move medium tanks up to attack his. With your other
medium tank, attack the tank on the yellow city. Take out the rocket in
the right with your bomber. Copter Command. Use northeast infantry and
battle copters to slowly eliminate those units. In the north, move
bombers up and attack anything in sight but don't go into missile/A-Air
range. Attack anything in sight, as this is the turning point. Build
medium tank from left base.
</li>
<li>Adder Day 7: Attack infantry with cannons. Attack a few units, feel 
doomed. Build an infantry.
</li>
<li>Sensei Day 8: Copter Command, thought you won't get units. Move up
units but still stay out of range of A-Air/bombers. Blow up eastern
seem. Move everything else up! That, and continue taking properties.
</li>
<li>Adder Day 8: Attacks bombers with cannons :P 
</li>
<li>Sensei Day 9: Send EVERYTHING up to destroy cannons. And the units
near them. You can hit the missile/A-Air, but it won't matter too
much here.
</li>
<li>Adder Day 9: Attack bombers. Attack everything else in sight. Feel
doomed.
</li>
<li>Sensei Day 10: Finish off all three cannons to win! Victory for Sensei!
Sensei scares away Adder :) .
