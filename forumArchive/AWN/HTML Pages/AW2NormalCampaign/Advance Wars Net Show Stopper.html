		<h1>Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising</h1>
<h1>Show Stopper</h1>
<p>
<b>Sonja vs. Adder
<br />Difficulty: ****</b>
</p>
<p><b>Mission Briefing:</b> Sonja's intel shows that the Black Hole forces 
are encamped there. Sonja spots the stronghold but Kanbei refuses to 
let her go. Sensei convinces Kanbei to let her go. Sonja spots the 
8 cannons surrounding the fortress and knows to kill all 8 to win 
or capture the HQ. Adder laughs, and Sonja quickly notices that 
it's CO Adder. There is a hidden map to the secret lab here, which 
is the southwesternmost neutral city. It's in FOW, so it's Sonja's 
specialty. It'll still annoy you a bit though...
