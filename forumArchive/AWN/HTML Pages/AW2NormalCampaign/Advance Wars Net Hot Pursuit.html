		<h1>Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising</h1>
<h1>Hot Pursuit</h1>
<p><b>OS CO (Andy) + BM CO (Grit) + GE CO (Jess) vs. Sturm
<br/>Difficulty: ******</b></p>

<p>"Attack the Black Hole citadel!" Here is the first mission you fight
Sturm in. Don't spell Strum, please...unless you think it's funny, haha.
Sturm is informed by his lieutenant Allied force movements into Black
Hole itself. Flak and Adder argue over taking command, but Sturm
insists on taking command himself. "You wretches report to the missile
platform and assist Lash." They leave, and Sturm is very disappointed
with their losses. "When this is finished, I will make...adjustments."
</p>
<p>Max tells Sami that this is Sturm's citadel, and Sami says that they
pillaged everything from allied countries and have them here. Jess
agrees to that, and Andy argues to get back their money here. Nell
thinks it got moved. Eagle and Olaf ask why, and Grit thinks the same
as Nell. Kanbei comes and asks for a general assault to take out the
cannons. Sonja says you must take out the 3 Black Cannons. They will
run if you take them out. Sensei agrees, and then they'd find out if
that was Sturm's HQ. "That's brilliant, Commander Sonja!" - Colin.
Indirect fire is useful here, and using decoys, as well as what COs
you use. 
</p>
<p>I suggest a combo of Andy, Grit, and Jess. OS gets 12 properties, while 
BM and GE get 10. YC doesn't seem to have an army.</p>

<p>Sturm is informed his Black Cannons have fallen, and sends an infantry
that is captured to tell of Sturm's real army to follow the trail to
Sturm's missile platform and be trapped, and launch missiles at Cosmo
Land and other continents. Nell got the intel through their own
intel-gathering team as well as through the soldier. Grit suspects it
is a trap. Sonja agrees. Allied commanders agree to attack with morale
still high and time still enough. "I'll win next time, too!" - Andy.
</p>
<p><b>Victory!</b> 94 Speed + 34 Power + 69 Technique = 197 Pts. = C-Rank
</p>
<p>OK, here we enter the last stage of the war, disarming and defeating
Sturm. Move to the last mission, a ******* one. </p>
