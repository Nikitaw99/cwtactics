<br/>Difficulty: ***</b>
</p>
<p><b>Northern Front:></b>
<br/>
<br/>OS: 1 APC, 4 Battle Copters, 1 Fighter, 1 Bomber
<br/>BM: 2 Infantry, 2 Mechs, 2 APCs, 2 Tanks, 2 A-Air, 1 Artillery, 1 Rocket
<br/>BH: 1 Infantry, 1 Mech, 1 Recon, 1 APC, 1 Artillery
</p>
<p><b>Central Front:</b>
<br/>
<br/>BM: 2 Tanks, 4 Medium Tanks, 1 Rocket, 1 Missile
<br/>BH: 4 Tanks, 4 Medium Tanks, 4 A-Air, 3 Rockets, 2 Missiles
</p>
<p><b>Southern Front:</b>
<br/>
<br/>BM: 2 Mech, 3 A-Air, 1 Rocket
<br/>BH: 1 Rocket, 2 Medium Tanks, 2 NeoTanks, 5 Battle Copters, 3 Bombers
</p>
<p>The Blue Moon COs spot a giant missile silo being operated by the Black
Hole Army. Surprisingly, Andy comes with a small air force to aid you
in Olaf's fight to take out the giant missile silo. In 15 days, your
forces will be blown up. 
</p>
<ul><li>Olaf Day 1: Send all your forces as far west as possible. 
</li>
<li>Andy Day 1: Move the bomber SE as far as possible. Move your back
battle copters all the way west to attack the APC and mech. Send the
fighter to the bomber. Send other two battle copters northwest,
avoiding the missile range. Send APC 2SE.
</li>
<li>Flak Day 1: He attacks Andy's APC. His forces move east. He builds
an infantry.
</li>
<li>Olaf Day 2: Grit informs Olaf that Olaf needs to capture the 8
cities in the middle to deactivate the tower. Andy reminds Olaf to
destroy the pipes. Capture cities in northwest, as much as you can.
Advance toward pipes on the Northern Front but do not attack it.
In the Central Front, attack as far west as you can, injuring both
rockets. Move everything as far west as well except for one medium tank
which should attack the southern pipeline and deal it 55 damage. In the
south, start capturing the airport with one mech and keep A-Air out of
bomber range.
</li>
<li>Andy Day 2: In the west, stay out of missile range and take out an APC,
recon, and mech. Use the bomber to bomb the northern pipeline and deal
it a massive 95 damage. Move APC 2E, end turn.
</li>
<li>Flak Day 2: Brute Force. Advance units east. Rockets attack your
attacking tanks in the middle. All units move east. Infantry built.
</li>
<li>Olaf Day 3: Use your 5HP tank to blow up the northern pipeline and
send units over. Finish capturing cities. In the south, capture the
airport and attack two bombers with two A-Air. Destroy a battle copter
with the other one. Try to keep your rocket protected, as he has
NeoTanks coming at you. Destroy two rockets with your small tank and
medium tanks in the center, then use big bad medium tanks to take damage
next turn while dealing heavy on those pesky BH A-Air. Send all units
possible from northern front down to central except for one APC. End.
</li>
<li>Andy Day 3: Move Andy's bomber 5S to destroy that pipeline. The missile
will destroy it, but you have to blow it up anyway...move your fighter
3S. Move your battle copters all east except one which should start
blowing up the northwest scorched pipeline to deal 25 damage. Move APC
down.
</li>
<li>Flak Day 3: Your medium tank is bombarded by his remaining rocket and
medium tank in the north, and his missile downs your only bomber. In 
the south, you lose an A-Air to a bomber while your mechs and rocket 
get random hits as well. 
</li>
<li>Olaf Day 4: Winter Fury! That Super CO Power unleashes slow AND deals
2 damage to all enemy units AND boosts your power. Weaken the near
full-health bomber in the south, and take out a battle copter. In the
north, use your rocket to knock hit points off of the medium tank. 
Use your artillery to take that out. Bring up a full health medium tank
to take out a small tank in the north of the Central Front. Use a tank
to clear the tank in the southern half, then finish off the A-Air with
your medium tank. Bring in your last one to form a solid medium tank
line and injure the tank. Send all units west (or southwest from
Northern Front). Remember to capture that last city up there...
</li>
<li>Andy Day 4: Continue giving a smack on that pipeline. Move other
battle copters east. Move APC south. Keep fighter out of missile range.
</li>
<li>Flak Day 4: Barbaric Blow. A rocket attacks northern medium tank. A
mech falls to battle copter fire on the Southern Front and together,
the air force wipes out a lot of your weakened army. The northern
medium tank is finished by another medium tank. He still makes another
infantry.
</li>
<li>Olaf Day 5: On the Southern Front, wipe out a battle copter and a
bomber. On the Central Front, use your northern rocket to take 5HP off
of the northern medium tank. With your southern rocket, attack the
missile. Finish off the 3HP small tank with your medium tank in the
south. Wipe out the missile with your other medium tank. Send two tanks
there to weaken the A-Airs. Finish capturing last city in the Northern
Front and send everything southwest. 
</li>
<li>Andy Day 5: Send fighter south to the Southern Front to wipe out the
bomber. Continue to kill the pipeline seam. Move battle copters down
to Central Front. 
</li>
<li>Flak Day 5: Infantry and rocket destroyed on southern front with battle
copters. A tank is attacked on the central front by another one.
</li>
<li>Olaf Day 6: On the Southern Front, take out both battle copters with
your A-Air. Build a bomber. With the rocket, weaken the small tank in
the north and finish it with your tank. Send up a high-HP tank to
attack the medium tank in the north and deal it 1 damage. Add an A-Air
to finish it from the north. Send an artillery there to get ready to
attack down that final rocket. In the south, take out an A-Air and
weaken the other one with two tanks. Move up a medium tank to attack
his. Move units west, south from northern front. 
</li>
<li>Andy Day 6: Move battle copters as far west as possible without getting
them in missile range. Take out the seam with the battle copter in the
west. Move APC west. Move fighter west to the forest to block ANY unit
from passing, so the NeoTanks won't make it.
</li>
<li>Flak Day 6: Brute Force. Your A-Air is weakened by the rocket, and his
medium tanks weaken a tank and destroy a medium tank. He builds an APC.
</li>
<li>Olaf Day 7: Day 7 now. You have 8 days to clear BH forces from Central
Sector and take cities. Hurry! Use an artillery and 2 tanks to take
out the northern rocket. Winter Fury. Use your medium tank to attack
his higher-HP one. With a tank, finish off his 1HP one. Use another
tank to finish off his A-Air. Have the mech start capturing a city.
Move rocket up so you can kill the medium tank next turn. On the
Southern Front, move your bomber and A-Air forward. 
</li>
<li>Andy Day 7: Move south towards Southern Front, but avoid missile range!
</li>
<li>Flak Day 7: An artillery nearly kills your tank. His medium tank
strikes your A-Air. He advances pointlessly on Southern Front.
</li>
<li>Olaf Day 8: Destroy the medium tank with your rocket. Send units to
attack missile. Send the rest to Southern Front. Move infantry and
mechs to capture the cities ASAP. Bomb down one NeoTank. Make another
bomber.
</li>
<li>Andy Day 8: Use battle copter to attack missile as well. Send other
battle copters to Southern Front along with APC. Move fighter west
to block units from getting through.
</li>
<li>Flak Day 8: Attack your A-Air. Advance.
</li>
<li>Olaf Day 9: Finish capturing THREE cities. Attack missile. Move units
to Southern Front. On Southern Front, destroy a NeoTank and a Medium
Tank with your bombers.
</li>
<li>Andy Day 9: Take out an infantry on Southern Front with battle copters.
Continue moving them south. Move battle copter north on Central Front
to chase artillery.
</li>
<li>Flak Day 9: Advance, move up A-Air, build mech.
</li>
<li>Olaf Day 10: Finish off missile, continue capturing cities, bomb
out a medium tank and rocket. Move units to Southern Front.
</li>
<li>Andy Day 10: Chase artillery on Northern Front. Eliminate two infantry
on Southern Front. 
</li>
<li>Flak Day 10: Barbaric Blow. He's pissed. He advances and builds a mech.
</li>
<li>Olaf Day 11: Blizzard. Finish capturing 5 cities. Advance to Southern
Front. Bomb the A-Air with both bombers. Take out a single infantry
unit with your A-Air. No need to move anything else. Build a bomber.
</li>
<li>Andy Day 12: On the northern front, deal 4 damage to that artillery.
Weaken a tank with battle copters. 
</li>
<li>Flak Day 12: Advance mechs, make another one.
</li>
<li>Olaf Day 13: Finish capturing 6th city, start capturing 7th and 8th 
cities. Send a tank up to the artillery on Northern Front. Wipe out
the tank with your rocket from Central Front. Bomb an APC and a mech.
</li>
<li>Andy Day 13: Hyper Repair. Take out a mech and APC on the Southern Front
and weaken a second mech. Attack the artillery from the west on Northern
Front.
</li>
<li>Flak Day 13: Move up mechs, build another one.
</li>
<li>Olaf Day 14: Victory day, here it is! On the northern front, take out
the artillery with your tank. In the south, weaken a mech and kill one.
Capture the last two properties. You win by neutralizing the missile
silo!
</li></ul>
<p>Olaf downplays the role of Andy, but he was quite useful, eh?
</p>
<p><b>Victory!</b> 100 Speed + 100 Power + 100 Technique = 300 Pts. = S-Rank!
</p>
<p>This victory opens up a mission to the northeast province with a star.
Go to the southeast island flag for Mission 13!
